         This feature holds a family of metamodels defined as ecore models
that together with its java and Xtext and Xtend grammar implementations
facilitates the use of a set of tools and graphical plugins to
create models from ROS code, compose and validate the composition
of models, autogenerate deployment artifacts and check the use
of standard specifications.
