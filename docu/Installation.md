# Installation and setup

### Option 1: Using the Release version (Recommended)

In Eclipse, go to *Help* > *Install New Software...*. To install the latest version of the ROS tooling, add the update site URL [http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/updatesite/latest/](http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/updatesite/latest/)(*) in the *Work with* section. If you wish to install an earlier version instead, go to the [the update site](http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/updatesite/), choose the desired version and copy its URL.

If none package is listed, please uncheck the option *Group items by category*. The category *ROS Model* appears in the *Name* area. Check the box in front of *ROS model* and click *Next* to review the list of items to be installed. Click *Next* again to read and accept the terms of the license agreements and afterwards click *Finish*. Eclipse will then start to install the ROS tooling and its dependencies. If you get a security warning about the authenticity, click OK. Finally, when asked, restart Eclipse to complete the installation process.


(*) Apart of the latest stable release of the tooling, some pre-releases for new feautures are available. See the following list of current pre-releases:

| Name | Code version | Update Site Link | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|TestComponentStack|https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/tree/1.4.0_TestComponentStacks|http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/updatesite/TestComponentStacks/latest/| Added to the RosSystem metamodel the option to group components forming components stacks. This pre-release is backward compatible for the models, but the validators and generators are **not** updated. If Xtext report errors, please ignore them. |
| v1.5 | https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/tree/1.5.0_pre-release |http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/updatesite/pre-release/latest/| Long term version of the grammar (simplified for the 1.4 release). **This version is not backwards compatible with 1.3 and earlier releases**|



To start using the ROS tooling continue with the [step 1](#1-switch-to-the-ros-developer-perspective)

### Option 2: Using the Eclipse Installer - Source installation (ROS tooling developers)

First the java environment have to be setup, for eclipse it is recomended the installation of the version 8 (i.e. X=8) for Ubuntu 16.04 and 11 (i.e. X=11) for the 18.04 and 20.04:
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre
```
Download the official [Eclipse Installer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer) for your preferred operating system. Execute the installer and choose the advanced mode (menu on the right-up corner). Select the Product *Eclipse Modeling tools* package, for the version it is recommended *2021-12*.

Press *Next* and add a new *User project* pressing the green button *+*:
```
Catalog: Github Projects
Resource URIs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipa320/ros-model/master/EclipseInstaller/ROSModel.setup
```
Sometimes eclipse is not able to find the file, for those cases we recommend to download the file to the local memory of the machine and import it:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipa320/ros-model/master/EclipseInstaller/ROSModel.setup
```

Select the the ROS Model project (under Github Projects -> <User>) and press next. 

By default the ROS tooling installation will be saved under the folder *ros-model-master* in your home directory. To ensure that you have access to get the source code from GitHub, select the check box *Show all variable* and change the *Ros model Github repository* to the *HTTPs(read-write)* option, verify that the option *Github user ID* is set to "anonymous".

Follow the installation instructions of the Oompth installer dialog, after the installation eclipse will be restarted to launch the ROS tooling configuration. Finally, when all the startup tasks finished press "Workbench".

To start using the ROS tooling continue with the [step 0](#0-start-the-ros-tooling-application)

# Setup the environment and start the eclipse application

### 0: Start the ROS tooling application

:bangbang::bangbang: This is only needed if you installed the toolig from [source](#option-2-using-the-eclipse-installer---source-installation-ros-tooling-developers), if you installed the release version please continue directly with the [step 1](#1-switch-to-the-ros-developer-perspective)

select de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.plugin and press the button *Run*

![alt text](images/run_ros_tooling.png)

### 1: Switch to the ROS Developer perspective

Go to Menu Window -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Other... -> ROS developer. Your application toolbar will be automatically configured.

### 2: Import the common communication objects project

import the project located under the "ROSCommonObjects" folder of this repository to the workbench of your application:
```
de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.communication.objects
```

If you have internet a button can clone from GitHub the objects to your workspace and import them automatically:

Now that your workspace is setup, you can start creating your [project and defining your ROS system](#Tutorials)
