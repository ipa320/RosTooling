## How to get deployment artifacts


### Preparation

Please be sure that the tool is installed and your workspace setup, see the [installation guide](../README.md) for further details.

Import the example project pub_sub_ros2 (from the [ros-model-examples](https://github.com/ipa-nhg/ros-model-examples) repository) to the workbench of your application:

```
pub_sub_ros2
```

Import the example project agriculture_demo_sprint2 (from the [ros-model-examples](https://github.com/ipa-nhg/ros-model-examples) repository) to the workbench of your application:

```
agriculture_demo_sprint2
```

Install docker and docker-compose

### Get get deployment artifacts

To create deployment artifacts you need to right click "*.rossystem" file.

#### Rossystem without parameters
In this case, you need to right click "communication.rossystem". Then you need to choose "Deployment Artifacts Generator".

A dialog will be open and ask you to select a ROS Distro. In this case, the rossystem doesn't contain parameters, so you only need to choose a ROS Distro.

This process is as shown blow.

Then deployment artifacts will automatically created, as you can find under "src-gen" folder

#### Rossystem with parameters

In some case, you need to choose device ports based on parameters defined in a rossystem.

For example, if you want to run teleop with a joystick in a docker container, docker need to know which port is the joystick connect to.

In this case, you need to right click "communication.rossystem". Then you need to choose "Deployment Artifacts Generator".

A dialog will be open and ask you to select a ROS Distro. In this case, the rossystem contains parameters, you need to choose the corresponding parameter to the joystick port value.

This process is as shown blow.

### Use github action to generate docker images

Once you get deployment artifacts, you can use git action to build and release docker images automatically.

If you already have a repository in github, you can use it. If not, you need to create a repository. For example, we use ("rossystem-deployment" repository)[https://github.com/ipa-rwu/rossystem-deployment.

You also need a dockerhub account. Once you have dockerhub account, you need to add your Docker ID as a secret to GitHub.
1. Add your Docker ID as a secret to GitHub. Navigate to your GitHub repository and click Settings > Secrets > New secret.
2. Create DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD

The result should looks like below.

In this repository, you need to create a folder ".github/workflows". Then you need to put a file with suffix "_workflow.yml" from a generated folder to this folder. For example, you can put "communication_foxy_workflow.yml" or "agriculture_robot_sprint3_noetic_workflow.yml" under ".github/workflows" folder, as shown below.

Then you need to put the generated folder in this repository. For example, we put "communication_ros2" and "agriculture_robot_sprint3" in the repository. The locations of these two folder as shown below.

You can push them to github. Github action will build docker image and push images in dockerhub.

### Start the system

Before starting the system, you need to modify "docker-compose" file. You need to add your docker account as prefix before a docker image name.
For example, we add "kogrob2" (docker hub account name) in front of "communication_foxy:latest", as shown below.

Then you can use the command below to start the system.
```
docker-compose up
```
